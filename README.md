# AgriPredict AI - Smart Farming Solutions

AgriPredict AI is a next-generation web application designed to empower farmers and agricultural stakeholders with smart, AI-driven tools for yield prediction, weather monitoring, and real-time decision making. The project leverages modern web technologies to provide an intuitive dashboard, interactive map, chatbot assistant, and actionable insights to enhance agricultural productivity, sustainability, and food security.

## Features

- **Yield Prediction:**  
  Select region and crop to receive AI-powered yield predictions along with confidence levels and influencing factors.

  Stay updated with recent weather alerts, pest warnings, and optimal harvest recommendations.

- **AI Chatbot Assistant:**  
  Get instant answers and recommendations for best farming practices, crop management, and troubleshooting via the integrated chatbot.

- **Data Visualization:**  
  Visualize historical and predicted trends (e.g., yield, rainfall) using interactive charts powered by [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/).

- **Responsive Design:**  
  Fully responsive and mobile-friendly for seamless usage in the field or office.
